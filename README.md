# What We Watched: A Netflix Engagement Report 2023

## Project Overview

Netflix had released engagement numbers for each TV show and movie available to subscribers which contains stats for the first half of 2023.

This is a comprehensive report of what people watched on Netflix over a six month period, including: 

•	Hours viewed for every title — original and licensed — watched for over 50,000 hours2; 

•	The premiere date for any Netflix TV series or film; and 

•	Whether a title was available globally. 

In total, this report covers more than 18,000 titles — representing 99% of all viewing on Netflix — and nearly 100 billion hours viewed.

## Data Source Used

The primary dataset used for this analysis in files named Netflix analysis.xls. The file contains information about date released, hours viewed and global availability. I have added other columns for my analysis as mentioned below.


## Tools Used

Microsoft Excel


## Analysis

I started by removing Duplicates first and filled the mising values from the sources available on netflix about TV shows and movies to maintain data integrity.

1.	From the given Release date, I have separated **Month**, **Year** and **Day** in different columns.

2.	**Distinguishing Content** - I have categorised titles whether its a Movie or a TV Show. To distinguish between movies and TV shows in the dataset, I employed a simple and easy rule: identifying the keyword **'Season'** in the title. This pattern appeared consistently across the data and proved perfect for distinguishing content.

3.	**Analyzing Viewing Trends**

  One of the first exploratory steps was to visualize how the cumulative hours viewed changed over time, which required parsing the release dates and grouping the data by year.

The graph illustrates a significant surge, especially noticeable after 2016.  It indicates not only an increase in number of viewers but also an increase in time spent by consumers on Netflix content which indicates strong viewer retention. This surge may be linked to Netflix's investment in creating great content and global presence.

Additionally, the absence of a growth plateau in the graph suggests that Netflix has been successful in responding to consumer demand thus captivating audience with its great content.
